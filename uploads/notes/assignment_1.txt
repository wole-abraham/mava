Geographical Co-ordinate system uses 3 dimensional spherical surfaces to define locations on Earth
-> co-ordinates are given as latitude and longitude

-> units: degree (decimal degree or degrees, minutes, second)

-> good for global data but no suitable for precise distance or area measurements

Projected Co-ordinate system (PCS) is flat 2D representation of the earth, derived by projecting geographic co-ordinate onto a plane

-> coverts lat and log into x,y co-ordinate
-> suitable for measuring distances, areas and mapping at local/regional scales
