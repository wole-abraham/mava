My name is Ayowole Ogunnowo, a passionate backend developer with a strong foundation in Python, Django, and web technologies. I'm currently studying Computer Science and also enrolled in the ALX Software Engineering program. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code, especially in areas like web automation, data management, and API development. In my spare time, I explore machine learning, experiment with LLMs like Mistral via Ollama, and occasionally dive into game development projects. I value clean, scalable code and love learning new tools that improve both efficiency and impact.
